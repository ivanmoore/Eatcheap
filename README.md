# Eatcheap
I currently eat for &lt;Â£4 per day while living in central London as an athlete who requires a certain amount of protein and calories every day. This is surely what computers were made for.

Usage for each function is spelled out in comments, to build, just download the file eatcheap.ijs and load it into J via qt or otherwise
